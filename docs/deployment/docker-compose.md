# Docker Compose

The main repository contains the `docker-compose.yaml` files to deploy recruIT via Docker Compose.
The following guides assume that you have cloned it to your current working directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miracum/recruit.git
cd recruit/
```

## Prerequisites

Docker CLI version 20.10.14 or later.

## Installation for local testing using sample data

To run everything locally with Keycloak-based authentication enabled, a sample cohort,
and an OMOP DB filled with sample data:

```sh
docker compose --project-name=recruit \
    --env-file=docker-compose/.staging.env \
    -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml \
    -f docker-compose/docker-compose.staging.yaml up
```

You can run the following to probe every component for its availability/health status:

!!! note

    The query module will only switch to its ready state if it has run at least once,
    so it may take up to 5 minutes for it to appear healthy.

```sh
docker compose --project-name=recruit \
    --env-file=docker-compose/.staging.env \
    -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml \
    -f docker-compose/docker-compose.staging.yaml \
    -f docker-compose/docker-compose.probe.yaml run health-probes
```

You can now access the services at the following localhost ports:

| Service                | Ingress URL                     | Note                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OHDSI Atlas            | <http://localhost:38084/atlas/> |                                                                                               |
| recruIT Screening List | <http://localhost:38080/>       | login with username: `user1` and password: `user1`; Or as `uc1-admin`/`admin` for full access |
| HAPI FHIR Server       | <http://localhost:38083/>       |                                                                                               |
| MailDev                | <http://localhost:38085/>       |                                                                                               |
| Keycloak               | <http://localhost:38086/>       | login with username: `admin` and password: `admin`                                            |

By default, the query module runs every 5 minutes to check for new study candidates. After some time, you should see
the following when opening the screening list at <http://localhost:38080/> and logging in as `uc1-admin`/`admin`:

Clicking on the list for the `SAMPLE M` study should show the list of candidates:

![Screening list for the sample study](../_img/docker-compose/list-sample-m.png)

Finally, checking the mail viewer at <http://localhost:38085/> you can see the email notifications:

## Standalone installation

The instructions above installed a FHIR server, a pre-filled OMOP database, the OHDSI tools initialized with a sample cohort,
a mock mail viewer, and pre-configured Keycloak.

This standalone, or "production-grade" installation assumes that you already have deployed a FHIR server, an OMOP database,
the OHDSI WebAPI and Atlas services, and optionally, Keycloak. All that's needed to do is configure the recruIT modules with the
correct parameters and start them.

Several environment variables need to be set before calling `docker-compose up`.
You can create a .env file in the current directory and set them according to your environment based on the `.staging.env`
example configuration file in the `docker-compose` folder.

You can find a [list of available configuration options here](../configuration/options.md).
