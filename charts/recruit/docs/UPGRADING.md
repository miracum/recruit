# Upgrading & Breaking Changes

## v10

Once more, all chart dependencies were updated to their latest major version. Particularly the HAPI FHIR and OHDSI chart
had breaking changes in the form of majorly updating their PostgreSQL sub-chart to v12 (based on PostgreSQL v15).

If you were using the included PostgreSQL databases, you will have to follow the instructions for [v9 below](#v9),
manually changing the PostgreSQL image versions as appropriate for your current deployment.

## v9

This updates all dependencies to their latest version. Both the included HAPI FHIR and the OHDSI sub-chart had breaking
changes in their new versions:

1. [OHDSI Helm chart breaking changes](https://github.com/chgl/charts/tree/master/charts/ohdsi#breaking-changes)

   The chart was updated from `0.8` to version `0.17`, both the `0.12` and the `0.14` breaking changes are relevant.

1. [HAPI FHIR server Helm chart breaking changes](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/blob/helm-v0.8.0/charts/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/Chart.yaml#L15)

   Similar to the OHDSI chart, the included PostgreSQL sub-chart was updated to a major version.

### Steps for manually updating from version `8.6.4` to `9.0.0` while keeping the databases

The easiest way to update is uninstalling the version 8 release without deleting the persistent volumes,
explicitly setting the previously used PostgreSQL container image versions and passwords in your `values.yaml`,
and newly installing version 9.

We assume that the chart was initially installed as follows:

> ⚠️ [docs/migrations/v8-to-v9/values-v8.yaml](migrations/v8-to-v9/values-v8.yaml) has enabled the notify module's HA-mode.
> Since this is a recent feature, disabled by default, you most likely have not enabled it and may want to set
> `notify.ha.enabled=false` and `postgresql.enabled=false` to keep HA disabled.

```sh
# versions 8 and below are only available on <https://harbor.miracum.org/chartrepo/charts>.
# Version 9.0.0 is available on both the MIRACUM Harbor and the <https://github.com/miracum/charts/> repository.
helm repo add miracum-gitlab https://harbor.miracum.org/chartrepo/charts

# the sample values in docs/migrations/v8-to-v9/values-v8.yaml only override the normally randomized
# passwords used by the included PostgreSQL sub-charts.
# ℹ️ the following is run from within this chart repository, `cd charts/recruit`, to access the `migrations` sample values.
helm install --version=8.6.4 -f docs/migrations/v8-to-v9/values-v8.yaml --create-namespace -n recruit recruit miracum-gitlab/recruit

# check the installed release

To begin updating to version 9 of this chart, first uninstall the old release:

```sh
# Uninstall the chart release
$ helm uninstall recruit -n recruit
release "recruit" uninstalled

# PVCs and volumes should be kept as-is
$ kubectl get pvc -n recruit
NAME                                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE

Install version 9 of the chart using the provided `values-v9.yaml`:

```sh
$ helm upgrade --install --version=9.0.0 -f docs/migrations/v8-to-v9/values-v9.yaml --create-namespace -n recruit recruit miracum-gitlab/recruit

# The upgrade is done.
```

## v8

The chart has been renamed from `uc1-recruit` to `recruit`.

The included HAPI FHIR server version was updated to 5.4.0. There isn't an automatic migration path for HAPI FHIR server
containers yet, so this is a breaking change unless you manually migrate your existing DB first.

This release also adds the OHDSI Helm chart as an optional dependency (enabled by default).

The pod/deployment labels have been updated to follow the Bitnami Helm conventions.

## v7

Starting with version 7.0.0 of this chart, the notification module has been updated to v3. The breaking change is related
to a completely revamped notification configuration, which allows setting the notification frequency.
See [Configure Notification Rules](../README.md#configure-notifcation-rules) below for an example config.

Additionally, several values that were previously globally scoped, have now been scoped to each component.
You can now configure `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, etc. per-component.

### v7.0.1

v7.0.1 is a small update with several unplanned breaking changes:

The `notify.mailServer` config has been split into `notify.mail.server` for SMTP settings and the additional
`notify.mail.from` and `notify.mail.screeningListLinkTemplate` settings.
See the [Configuration Section](../README.md#configuration) below for details

## v6

Starting with v6.0.0 of this chart all labels have been updated to be conformant to the Kubernetes' guidelines (<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/>).
This means that you can't just update your release using `helm upgrade` but need to uninstall the old release first.

This major release also updates the screening list component to v2, which requires an existing Keycloak installation to run.
The following values need to be set:

```yaml
list:
  auth:
    # if enabled, requires authentication before accessing the screening list
    enabled: true
    keycloak:
      clientId: "" # required
      realm: "UC1"
      url: "" # required
```

While it's not recommended, you can set `list.auth.enabled=false` to allow anonymous access to the screening list.
