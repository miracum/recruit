# recruIT Helm Chart

{{ template "chart.typeBadge" . }}

This chart deploys the recruIT clinical trial recruitment support system on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes v1.21+
- Helm v3.8+

## Upgrades & Breaking Changes

See [UPGRADING.md](./docs/UPGRADING.md) for information on breaking changes introduced by major version bumps and instructions on how to update.

## Sample usage

```sh
helm install recruit oci://ghcr.io/miracum/recruit/charts/recruit -n recruit
```

> âš  By default, the included [PostgreSQL Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql#upgrading)
> auto-generates a random password for the database which may cause problems when upgrading the chart (see [here for details](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql#upgrading)).

## Configure Notifcation Rules

The notification rules can be directly configured inside your values.yaml. For example:

```yaml
notify:
  enabled: true
  rules:
    # create custom notification schedules using https://www.cronmaker.com
    # these are later referenced used when configuring the notification frequency per user.
    # Note that the user will only receive an email notification if the scheduled time has been
    # reached _and_ there has been a _new_ patient recommendation since the last one.An identical
    # email won't be relentlessly sent everyMorning/Monday/Hour etc...
    schedules:
      everyMorning: "0 0 8 1/1 * ? *"
      everyMonday: "0 0 8 ? * MON *"
      everyHour: "0 0 0/1 1/1 * ? *"
      everyFiveMinutes: "0 0/5 * 1/1 * ? *"

    # trials are identified by their acronym which corresponds to the cohort's title in Atlas or the "[acronym=XYZ]" tag
    trials:
      # a value of '*' matches every trial, so 'everything@example.com' will receive an email whenever any screeninglist
      # gets updated.
      - acronym: "*"
        subscriptions:
          - email: "everything@example.com"

      - acronym: "SAMPLE"
        # the new "accessibleBy" key allows specifying users either by username or email address that
        # are allowed to access the screening list
        accessibleBy:
          users:
            - "user1"
            - "user.two@example.com"
        subscriptions:
          - email: "everyMorning@example.com"
            # each 'notify'-value corresponds to one schedule
            notify: "everyMorning"
            # a lack of a 'notify'-key with an associated schedule means that the user will be notified immediately.
          - email: "immediately-sample@example.com"
            # For example, the following entry means that if the 'SAMPLE' trial received new screening recommendations,
            # an email is sent to 'everyMonday@example.com' on the next monday. This is useful for aggregating notifications
            # about screening recommendations.
          - email: "everyMonday@example.com"
            notify: "everyMonday"

      - acronym: "AMICA"
        subscriptions:
          - email: "immediately-amica@example.com"
          - email: "everyHour1@example.com"
            notify: "everyHour"
          - email: "everyHour2@example.com"
            notify: "everyHour"
          - email: "everyFiveMinutes@example.com"
            notify: "everyFiveMinutes"
```
